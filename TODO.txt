High prio
    list of errornomous hosts:
        - flechter.de
            - cryptography.exceptions.InvalidSignature raised
            => should not happen during a scan
        - iber.com
            - TLS1.3 config contains empty sig_algs. To be checked.
        - assa.com
            - exception: signature scheme None not supported

    Ellipsis in resumption plugin.
    Restructure server profile, e.g. GeneralName

Medium prio

Low prio
    - more command line options, e.g. to scan only via IPv4 or IPv6
    - cover all key exchange algorithms in mappings.key_exchange
      - ECDH_ANON is supported as well, but we need a test case
    - HelloRetryRequest
    - more scan results
    - ROBOT:
        www.fassilnet.com.bo (weak)
        shopapi.gzypysm.cn (weak)
        fsco-arctics.fsco.gov.on.ca (weak, 142.46.20.134)
        timetracker.ctepl.com (strong)

Nice to have
    - more checks on server_hello: have the stuff selected by the server
      actually been offered?
    - use :class:`XXX` iso :obj: in the *.rst files where appropriate
    - refactoring: Alert and CCS(?): do they need a msg_type?
      or to enable/disable specific parts of the trace.
    - consistently use "verify" or "validate" when checking sigatures and certificates
    - cleanups for certificate parsing required:
        - implement quite a lot of missing stuff, e.g. proper handling of cert policies, etc.
    - scan for adfg.de fails with invalid signature
