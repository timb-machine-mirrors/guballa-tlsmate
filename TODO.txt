High prio
    - client authentication:
      - test case for client auth
    - recorder: implement the original delay for replaying messages
    - Add conn.wait(msg.NoMessage, timout=xxx) to wait for nothing, i.e. implementing a delay
    - add basic client profiles, e.g. firefox-like settings for the client_hello

Medium prio
    - implement makefile for test cases generation, where the openssl-server is started with
      the correct parameters.

Low prio
    - more command line options, e.g. to scan only specific versions,
    - cover all key exchange algorithms in mappings.key_exchange
      - ECDH_ANON is supported as well, but we need a test case
    - HelloRetryRequest
    - more scan results
    - improved error handling, e.g. if host name cannot be resolved

Nice to have
    - more checks on server_hello: have the stuff selected by the server
      actually been offered?
    - use :class:`XXX` iso :obj: in the *.rst files where appropriate
    - refactoring: Alert and CCS(?): do they need a msg_type?
      or to enable/disable specific parts of the trace.
    - consistently use "verify" or "validate" when checking sigatures and certificates
    - cleanups for certificate parsing required:
        - implement quite a lot of missing stuff, e.g. proper handling of cert policies, etc.
