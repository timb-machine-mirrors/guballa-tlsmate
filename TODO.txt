    - support for renegotiation
    - HelloRetryRequest
    - more scan results
    - improved error handling, e.g. if host name cannot be resolved
    - more checks on server_hello: have the stuff selected by the server
      actually been offered?
    - use __str__ for messages and extension displaying their names, cover all enums as well
    - use :class:`XXX` iso :obj: in the *.rst files where appropriate
    - cover all key exchange algorithms in mappings.key_exchange
      - ECDH_ANON is supported as well, but we need a test case
    - refactoring: Alert and CCS(?): do they need a msg_type?
    - more command line options, e.g. to scan only specific versions,
      or to enable/disable specific parts of the trace.
    - implement proper handling of the scenario for session_tickets:
      - adapt check if new session ticket was received to decide if the second
        handshake must be performed
    - consistently use "verify" or "validate" when checking sigatures and certificates
    - replace "pickle" by YAML/JSON for security reasons (deserialization of objects)
    - cleanups for certificate parsing required:
        - move the code from server_profile to scan_command?
        - implement quite a lot of missing stuff, e.g. proper handling of CRL, cert policies, etc.
        - use more classes
        - documentation
    - recorder for CRL access
