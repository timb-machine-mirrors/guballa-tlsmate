    - HelloRetryRequest
    - more scan results
    - improved error handling, e.g. if host name cannot be resolved
    - more checks on server_hello: have the stuff selected by the server
      actually been offered?
    - use :class:`XXX` iso :obj: in the *.rst files where appropriate
    - cover all key exchange algorithms in mappings.key_exchange
      - ECDH_ANON is supported as well, but we need a test case
    - refactoring: Alert and CCS(?): do they need a msg_type?
    - more command line options, e.g. to scan only specific versions,
      or to enable/disable specific parts of the trace.
    - consistently use "verify" or "validate" when checking sigatures and certificates
    - cleanups for certificate parsing required:
        - move the code from server_profile to scan_command?
        - implement quite a lot of missing stuff, e.g. proper handling of CRL, cert policies, etc.
        - use more classes
        - documentation
    - analitika.traktir.ru: Supports SSLv2 but there are problems to be resolved regarding the certificate chain
    - api2.bb.com.br: scan fails (SSLv2)
    - moag.gov.il: scan failed
    - www.howard.edu: scan failed
    - mail.mm-grp.com: scan failed
    - CRL: don't use CRL from issuer, use own CRL
    - Add conn.wait(msg.NoMessage, timout=xxx) to wait for nothing, i.e. implementing a delay
    - recorder: implement the original delay for replaying messages
    - implement makefile for test cases generation, where the openssl-server is started with 
      the correct parameters.
