    - support for sessions tickets
    - support for renegotiation
    - support for tls13
    - support for SSL2 (low prio)
    - refactoring: instead of passing every attribute to the record layer as a single
      item, we could pass the namedtuples we have already anyway when mapping a
      cipher suite to the cipher and mac.
    - generate a server profile (including export to yaml)
    - verify signatures (signed public key)
    - certificate validation and extraction to server profile
    - add a progress feedback, e.g. print a dot for each handshake
    - debug-logging: First log the incoming message type, then the parameters
