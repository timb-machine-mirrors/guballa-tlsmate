High prio
    list of errornomous hosts:
        - google.de
            -exception
        - bsi.de
            - Certificate extensions IssuerAltName not implemented
            - exception
        - bunte.de, cdef.de
            - no connection at all
        - flechter.de
            - cryptography.exceptions.InvalidSignature raised
            => should not happen during a scan


Medium prio

Low prio
    - more command line options, e.g. to scan only via IPv4 or IPv6
    - cover all key exchange algorithms in mappings.key_exchange
      - ECDH_ANON is supported as well, but we need a test case
    - HelloRetryRequest
    - more scan results

Nice to have
    - more checks on server_hello: have the stuff selected by the server
      actually been offered?
    - use :class:`XXX` iso :obj: in the *.rst files where appropriate
    - refactoring: Alert and CCS(?): do they need a msg_type?
      or to enable/disable specific parts of the trace.
    - consistently use "verify" or "validate" when checking sigatures and certificates
    - cleanups for certificate parsing required:
        - implement quite a lot of missing stuff, e.g. proper handling of cert policies, etc.
    - scan for adfg.de fails with invalid signature
